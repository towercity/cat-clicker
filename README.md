# Cat Clicker - List Style

A simple game in which you click one of five provided pictures of beautiful cats
and watch as your score counts soar! Click the name of your favorite cat along
the left of the screen and give it all the clicks your heart desires. Each cat's
score is held separately. Used as an exercise in changing a project's goal and
implementation as times goes on.

Also included is an admin function, which allows you to view and edit the data
for each cat from the browser window.
